= Elastic LRUCache replacement using SIEVE and different approach to backing datastructures

== Implementation

For simplicity, we rely on ConcurrentLinkedDeque and ConcurrentHashMap as backing datastructures. Perhaps greater
performance can be squeezed by inlining, but this would require reimplementing said datastructures, which albeit fun,
would make the code more complex, requires more review and testing for correctness.

== Eviction

Departing from the Least Recently Used we use a 'sieve' to select entries for eviction instead.
The Benchmarks included are microbenchmarks for put, get and invalidateAll. Testing of the eviction
strategy requires more real world workloads in which case we should do comparative end-to-end tests
with the code integrated into Elasticsearch for the full picture. We take the research and
<a href="https://junchengyang.com/publication/nsdi24-SIEVE.pdf">paper</a> on SIEVE as a good enough basis to move
forward.

== Microbenchmark results
Below are pictures of the MixedPutGetBenchmark run. You should run your own benchmarks:tm: and micro benchmarks might
not reflect in real workloads and other usual performance testing gotchas apply. The benchmarking was done on a not
entirely 'clean' machine, as it was run on my laptop. But the results are consistent over many runs with respect to
comparative results.
